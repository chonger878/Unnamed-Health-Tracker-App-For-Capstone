This is the repository for the AD 490 Capstone project.  The purpose of this project is to create a new symptoms tracker app where users can report on symptoms that is usually not discussed by researchers.  This could potentially open up to more research and/or even a cure.  
I read this article from Medium: https://mobileappcircular.com/ndroid-may-be-replaced-by-fuchsia-in-the-next-five-years-have-you-heard-c89e9cac0e58, in which the author discusses that fuchsia might be replacing Android, so I plan on researching more about Fuchsia and playing around with the OS.
